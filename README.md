# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to see the weekly rates of PyBer rides in different city types. In practicing this analysis, we learned how to use Matplotlib, pyplot, numpy, and we expanded out pandas skills as well. The skills we learned in this module will be useful to help create meaningful graphs and charts to help tell stories about data we work with in the future.

## Results

Overall, we learned that Urban areas get the highest rate of individual rides and, therefore, the highest total fares of any of the city types. This is illustrated by the image below where you can clearly see that Urban cities maintain their rate of rides and total fares no matter what month you look at between the beginning of January 2019 and the end of April 2019.

## Summary

If I were to make recommendations to the CEO of PyBer about how to close the gap in total fares, I would suggest changing rates by city type. There is an inverse relationship between average fares and total fares per ride in Urban areas compared to Suburban and Rural rides as seen below.

Because of this I would suggest raising rates in urban areas to bump up average rate per ride. This could possibly be done by instituting a base rate for a certain distance given there is a higher density of destinations in an urban area. Additionally I would suggest they somehow incentivise drivers to seek out rides in Rural and Suburban areas as the average fare is higher in those areas, likely meaning rides are longer. This could be accomplished by setting up higer earning zones for drivers in those Suburban or Rural areas. To go along with that suggestion I would also pitch the idea of gathering data on high volume events in Rural and Suburban areas where higher earning zones could also be implemented to attract drivers to a particular area when popular events are happening.
